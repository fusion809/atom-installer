# Contributing
You would like to contribute to this project? Great! I am happy to have you as a co-developer of the Atom installer. This document is designed to help you file a useful bug report or write a helpful pull request description.

## Bug Reports
If you are filing a bug report, wherein the installer fails, giving an error message please include the error message and at least 10 lines of output leading up to it. Please also tell me your operating system (that is, its name, version and architecture). If you cannot start Atom after running the installer please run `atom` from a terminal window and tell me what error message you got.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome, they can be to solve open bug reports, fixing errors in the scripts (ones that will likely lead to a bug report, with enough time), adding features to the installer or adding support for additional Linux distribution(s) to the installer. Before you file a pull request please **test out your changes** on the relevant Linux distribution(s). For example, if you wish to add support for additional operating system(s) to this installer please test out your changes to this installer on the additional operating system(s), in question. If it is possible your changes may impact on this installer's performance on other operating systems (edits to `quick-install.sh`, `installer.sh`), please test them out on these other operating systems before filing a pull request.
